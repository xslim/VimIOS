VimIOS -- A port of Vim to iOS 9+
*ios*

Disclaimer: This is a side project of mine - no promises and no warranties. If you like it, feel free to let me know, and please feel free to improve on it, there is a lot to do.

This project is based on the [Vim port of applidium](https://github.com/applidium/Vim), which has been inactive for a few years. Nonetheless, it is a full port of Vim, but since its inceptions, iOS has gained many features of which this port did not take advantage. I large parts of it with the goal of improving the Vim experience under iOS 9, in particular on iPads with an external keyboard. 

The new key features are:
* Split View and Slide Over support
* Full external key board support
* Importing and exporting files from Vim to other apps is now possible. 
* Vim now looks great on retina displays

==============================================================================
1. Usage
Open the app and just start typing. If you have an external keyboard, you should be all set. If you need an escape key, or F1, longpress anywhere on the screen. But instead of escape, you can also use `<C-[>`. 

You can get this help by using the command `:help ios`.

FILE MANAGEMENT				*ios_file_management*
This version of Vim comes with a version of the netrw file browser. Use the command `e .` to start it. You will likely see the following items:

>
.vim/
Inbox/
.viminfo
.vimrc
<

If `.vimrc` does not exist, you can create it, if you wish. 

You can write your files anywhere, except for the `Inbox/` folder, see below.
Use `F1` to get help on how to use the file browser. You can create directories with `d' and delete directories/files with `D'. 

THE INBOX FOLDER				*inbox*
This is a special folder. Files imported from other applications will be saved there. **Note that you cannot save to the Inbox folder manually**. In particular, if you import a file, and make changes, then you *have* to save the new file somewhere outside the Inbox folder.

IMPORTING FILES FROM OTHER APPLICATIONS		*importing* *airdrop*
If you would like to edit a file in Vim that is currently in the sandbox of another application (e.g. the brilliant [Working Copy](http://workingcopyapp.com)), simply go to this app and use standard iOS dialog "Open in another app". Pick VimIOS, the file will be copied to the VimIOS sandbox, and Vim will be opened. **Important**: The file will be imported and saved into the directory `Inbox`. If you want to make changes to this file, you **have** to save it outside the `Inbox` directory. 
This process also works with files shared via Airdrop.

EXPORTING FILES TO OTHER APPLICATIONS		*exporting* *:Share* *:Mail*
I added two commands to commands to Vim which allow you to export files. 
* `:Share` opens the standard iOS dialog "Open in other app". You can also export your file via Airdrop.
* `:Mail` opens a slightly different dialog, which allows you to export your text as the body of an email. 

==============================================================================

2. Customization
In the `.vim` folder (create it, if it doesn't exist), you can add plugins and themes as usual. I have not tested many plugins; obviously those utilizing many features external to Vim will not work, as iOS does not provide a shell to Vim.

==============================================================================

3. Todo

It would be very nice to implement the new iOS document picker feature, which would allow Vim to open files directly from the sandbox of a (compatible) app, such as several cloud storage providers. Unfortunately, this can only implemented by a developer who has an Apple Developer subscription. Also note, that this would require the implementation of an at least rudimentary document management system, as the document picker extension only works with applications implementing documenent management modeled on UIDocument. At the moment, this app uses the document management provided by Vim itself.
